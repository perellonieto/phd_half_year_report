abstract = {In many real-world problems, labels are often weak, meaning that each instance is labelled as belonging to one of several candidate categories, at most one of them being true. Recent theoretical contributions have shown that it is possible to construct proper losses or classification calibrated losses for weakly labelled classification scenarios by means of a linear transformation of conventional proper or classification calibrated losses, respectively. However, how to translate these theoretical results into practice has not been explored yet. This paper discusses both the algorithmic design and the potential advantages of this approach, analyzing consistency and convexity issues arising in practical settings, and evaluating the behavior of such transformations under different types of weak labels.},

In this paper we present a new non-parametric calibration method called Bayesian Binning into Quantiles (BBQ) which addresses key limitations of existing calibration methods. The method post processes the output of a binary classification algorithm; thus, it can be readily combined with many existing classification algorithms. The method is computationally tractable, and empirically accurate, as evidenced by the set of experiments reported here on both real and simulated datasets.},

@article{Platt1999,
abstract = {The output of a classifier should be a calibrated posterior probability to enable post-processing. Standard SVMs do not provide such probabilities. One method to create probabilities is to directly train a kernel classifier with a logit link function and a regularized maximum likelihood score. However, training with a maximum likelihood score will produce non-sparse kernel machines. Instead, we train an SVM, then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the SVM outputs into probabilities. This chapter compares classification error rate and likelihood scores for an SVM plus sigmoid versus a kernel method trained with a regularized likelihood error function. These methods are tested on three data-mining-style data sets. The SVM+sigmoid yields probabilities of comparable quality to the regularized maximum likelihood kernel method, while still retaining the sparseness of the SVM.},

@article{Cour2011,
abstract = {We address the problem of partially-labeled multiclass classification, where instead of a single label per instance, the algorithm is given a candidate set of labels, only one of which is correct. Our setting is motivated by a common scenario in many image and video collections, where only partial access to labels is available. The goal is to learn a classifier that can disambiguate the partially-labeled training instances, and generalize to unseen data. We define an intuitive property of the data distribution that sharply characterizes the ability to learn in this setting and show that effective learning is possible even when all the data is only partially labeled. Exploiting this property of the data, we propose a convex learning formulation based on minimization of a loss function appropriate for the partial label setting. We analyze the conditions under which our loss function is asymptotically consistent, as well as its generalization and transductive performance. We apply our framework to identifying faces culled from web news sources and to naming characters in TV series and movies; in particular, we annotated and experimented on a very large video data set and achieve 6{\%} error for character naming on 16 episodes of the TV series Lost.},

Instead, we can collect subjective (possibly noisy) labels from multiple experts or annotators. In practice, there is a substantial amount of disagreement among the annotators, and hence it is of great practical interest to address conventional supervised learning problems in this scenario. In this paper we describe a probabilistic approach for supervised learning when we have multiple annotators providing (possibly noisy) labels but no absolute gold standard. The proposed algorithm evaluates the different experts and also gives an estimate of the actual hidden labels. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the commonly used majority voting baseline.},

We discover that modern neural networks, unlike those from a decade ago, are poorly calibrated. Through extensive experiments, we observe that depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration. We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-of-the-art architectures with image and document classification datasets. Our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into neural network learning, but also provide a simple and straightforward recipe for practical settings: on most datasets, temperature scaling -- a single-parameter variant of Platt Scaling -- is surprisingly effective at calibrating predictions.},

@article{Kull2017,
abstract = {For optimal decision making under variable class distributions and misclassification costs a classifier needs to produce well-calibrated estimates of the posterior probability. Isotonic calibration is a powerful non-parametric method that is however prone to overfitting on smaller datasets; hence a parametric method based on the logistic curve is commonly used. While logistic calibration is designed for normally distributed per-class scores, we demonstrate experimentally that many classifiers including Naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from a particular distortion where these score distributions are heavily skewed. In such cases logistic calibration can easily yield probability estimates that are worse than the original scores. Moreover, the logistic curve family does not include the identity function, and hence logistic calibration can easily uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated classifier. In this paper we solve all these problems with a richer class of calibration maps based on the beta distribution. We derive the method from first principles and show that fitting it is as easy as fitting a logistic curve. Extensive experiments show that beta calibration is superior to logistic calibration for Naive Bayes and Adaboost.},

In the superset learning problem, the outcome is only characterized in terms of a superset‚Äîa subset of candidates that covers the true outcome but may also contain additional ones. Thus, superset learning can be seen as a specific type of weakly supervised learning, in which training examples are ambiguous. In this paper, we introduce a generic approach to superset learning, which is motivated by the idea of performing model identification and ‚Äúdata disambiguation‚Äù simultaneously. This idea is realized by means of a generalized risk minimization approach, using an extended loss function that compares precise predictions with set-valued observations. As an illustration, we instantiate our meta learning technique for the problem of label ranking, in which the output space consists of all permutations of a fixed set of items. The label ranking method thus obtained is compared to existing approaches tackling the same problem.},

Results of Monte Carlo simulations performed using multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks trained with backpropagation, radial basis function (RBF) networks, and high-order polynomial networks graphically demonstrate that network outputs provide good estimates of Bayesian probabilities. Estimation accuracy depends on network complexity, the amount of training data, and the degree to which training data reflect true likelihood distributions and a priori class probabilities.

The resulting notion of 'safety' provides a fresh perspective on foundational issues in statistics, providing a middle ground between imprecise probability and multiple-prior models on the one hand and strictly Bayesian approaches on the other. It also allows us to formalize fiducial distributions in terms of the set of random variables that they can safely predict, thus taking some of the sting out of the fiducial idea. By restricting probabilistic inference to safe uses, one also automatically avoids paradoxes such as the Monty Hall problem. Safety comes in a variety of degrees, such as 'validity' (the strongest notion), 'calibration', 'confidence safety' and 'unbiasedness' (almost the weakest notion).},

abstract = {When labelled training data is plentiful, discriminative techniques are widely used since they give excellent generalization performance. However, for large-scale applications such as object recognition, hand labelling of data is expensive, and there is much interest in semi-supervised techniques based on generative models in which the majority of the training data is unlabelled. Although the generalization performance of generative models can often be improved by {\&}{\#}145;training them discriminatively{\&}{\#}146;, they can then no longer make use of unlabelled data. In an attempt to gain the benefit of both generative and discriminative approaches, heuristic procedure have been proposed [2, 3] which interpolate between these two extremes by taking a convex combination of the generative and discriminative objective functions. In this paper we adopt a new perspective which says that there is only one correct way to train a given model, and that a {\&}{\#}145;discriminatively trained{\&}{\#}146; generative model is fundamentally a new model [7]. From this viewpoint, generative and discriminative models correspond to specific choices for the prior over parameters. As well as giving a principled interpretation of {\&}{\#}145;discriminative training{\&}{\#}146;, this approach opens door to very general ways of interpolating between generative and discriminative extremes through alternative choices of prior. We illustrate this framework using both synthetic data and a practical example in the domain of multi-class object recognition. Our results show that, when the supply of labelled training data is limited, the optimum performance corresponds to a balance between the purely generative and the purely discriminative.},

abstract = {One-class classification has important applications such as outlier and novelty detection. It is commonly tackled using density estimation techniques or by adapting a standard classification algorithm to the problem of carving out a decision boundary that describes the location of the target data. In this paper we investigate a simple method for one-class classification that combines the application of a density estimator, used to form a reference distribution, with the induction of a standard model for class probability estimation. In this method, the reference distribution is used to generate artificial data that is employed to form a second, artificial class. In conjunction with the target class, this artificial class is the basis for a standard two-class learning problem. We explain how the density function of the reference distribution can be combined with the class probability estimates obtained in this way to form an adjusted estimate of the density function of the target class. Using UCI datasets, and data from a typist recognition problem, we show that the combined model, consisting of both a density estimator and a class probability estimator, can improve on using either component technique alone when used for one-class classification. We also compare the method to one-class classification using support vector machines.},

@article{Goodfellow2014,
abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversar- ial process; in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution; and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather thanG. The train- ing procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D; a unique solution exists; with G recovering the training data distribution andD equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G andD are defined by multilayer perceptrons; the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference net- works during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples. 1},

abstract = {Consider the class of problems in which a target class is well-defined, and an outlier class is ill-defined. In these cases new outlier classes can appear, or the class-conditional distribution of the outlier class itself may be poorly sampled. A strategy to deal with this problem involves a two-stage classifier, in which one stage is designed to perform discrimination between known classes, and the other stage encloses known data to protect against changing conditions. The two stages are, however, interrelated, implying that optimising one may compromise the other. In this paper the relation between the two stages is studied within an ROC analysis framework. We show how the operating characteristics can be used for both model selection, and in aiding in the choice of the reject threshold. An analytic study on a controlled experiment is performed, followed by some experiments on real-world datasets with the distance-based reject-option classifier.},

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.   The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

abstract = {Several machine learning models, including neural networks, consistently misclassify adversarial examples--inputs formed by applying small but intentionally worst-case perturbations to examples from the dataset, such that the perturbed input results in the model outputting an incorrect answer with high confidence. Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.},

This is relevant, for instance, for obtaining calibrated multi-class probabilities from two-class probability scores. The LS-ECOC method approaches this by performing least-squares fitting over a suitable error-correcting output code matrix, where the optimisation resolves potential conflicts in the input probabilities. While this gives all input probabilities equal weight, we would like to spend less effort fitting unreliable probability estimates. We introduce the concept of a reliability map to accompany the more conventional notion of calibration map; and LS-ECOC-R which modifies LS-ECOC to take reliability into account. We demonstrate on synthetic data that this gets us closer to the Bayes-optimal classifier, even if the base classifiers are linear and hence have high bias.
